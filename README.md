# MeGA: Merging Multiple Independently Trained Neural Networks Based on Genetic Algorithm

The provided repository contains the necessary instructions and information to reproduce the findings of our study, "MeGA: Merging Multiple Independently Trained Neural Networks Based on Genetic Algorithm".

# Setup
Clone this repository to your local workspace:

    $ git clone https://github.com/YUNBLAK/GANN-Genetic-Algorithm-Based-Weights-Fusion-of-Two-Independently-Trained-Neural-Network.git

# Independencies
    Numpy == 1.26.2
    TensorFlow == 2.15.0

# Usage
For multiple-GANN, just use this command

    $ python multiple-mega.py

For GANN for merging only two models, just use this command

    $ python mega.py
